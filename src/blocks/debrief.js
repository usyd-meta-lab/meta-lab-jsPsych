  <h4>1. What is this study about?</h4>
  <p>Thank you for completing the research study metacognition and cognitive performance. This study aims to understand how metacognitive self-evaluation affects cognitive performance.</p>
  <p>Self-evaluation involves rating or evaluating your performance in some way. Self-evaluating while performing cognitive tasks (e.g., problem-solving tasks, memory tests) has been shown to affect performance. Generally, self-evaluation has a positive effect on cognitive performance, though this is not always the case. This research is interested in how people change their approach to problem-solving and other cognitive problems as a result of being asked to self-evaluate.</p>
  <p>The study randomly assigned participants to complete a cognitive task either with or without prompting them to self-evaluate (by asking them to provide self-report ratings of their performance). We will assess how performing this self-evaluation affected cognitive performance on the task (i.e. did it improve or impair performance). If you have any questions, now or at a later time, please feel free to contact Dr Kit Double (kit.double@sydney.edu.au).</p>
  <p>The ethical aspects of this study have been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of The University of Sydney 2022/796 according to the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007).</p>
  <p>If you are concerned about the way this study is being conducted or you wish to make a complaint to someone independent from the study, please contact the University:</p>
